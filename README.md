This is a small script that enables you to transfer/claim various coins in Bitcoin forks
without downloading the full blockchains or messing with the official clients.

Requires Python 2.7

This fork only supports the broadcasting of signed raw transactions. (such as made using the clients, useful for broadcasting multisig transactions)

USAGE OF THIS SCRIPT IS RISKY AND IF YOU MISTYPE ANYTHING YOU CAN LOSE ALL YOUR COINS
